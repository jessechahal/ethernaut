# Ethernaut
The goal of this project is to go through all of zeppelin's solidity quizzes/levels on ethernaut. Ethernaut is a 'game' where each level essentially represents a hack that has happened to smart contracts in the past. For each level you need to figure out why the smart contract is in-secure or designed badly and hack them. Usually you need to either steal all the tokens/coins in a given contract or take ownership of the deployed contract itself. 

## Requirements
- have metamask installed
  - configure it to run on ropsten network



## My Ethereum Wallet
All questions were done using below address on ropsten.
Ropsten network: ```0x829902b5917C153e04d0f437e94849432b9Ed386```

I also had to re-do some of the questions in order to type out this repo. I ended up doing a few levels twice, other account can be found below. 
```0x28729797D665A11637d6323F095b87486a917ba1```

Notes
Some things i noticed after solving a few of the problems and going back to type out the answers in this repo
- https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/next/packages/truffle-contract/lib/contract.js explains some of the magic variables that exist in chrome dev tools during levels. Ethernaut is a truffle contract?! not quiet clear exactly how they play together yet but some information is given in Level0 within ethernaut.
  - I'll investigate truffle sometime in the future
